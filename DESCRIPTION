Description: The {gcd} package for R contains several tools for working with latitude and longitude values and obtaining estimated distances between points. The name of the package comes from the term "great circle distance" used to describe distances on the surface of the "Great Circle" (Earth). There are a few different methods for estimating the distance with varying trade-offs of efficiency vs. accuracy.
  -Spherical Law of Cosines (slc): assumes spherical shape; sensitive to very close distances
  -Haversine formula (haversine): assumes spherical shape; more robust to close distances
  -Vincenty inverse formula for ellipsoids (vincenty): uses ellipsoid shape with Earth's polar radius and equatorial radius Using these methods, the {gcd} package allows users to make easy measurements from place to place on the Earth's surface in km or miles.
  Additionally, the {gcd} package now includes a funtion to calculate the drive time between two points, as radians or degrees, using the HERE.com Routing API.
